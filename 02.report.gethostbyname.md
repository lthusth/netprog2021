* IP address of usth.edu.vn still exactly the same when compared between my laptop and VPS
* IP address of google.com:
* There are 6 ip addresses are found in VPS, but on my laptop there is only 1 ip address.
* I think the reason is because when we run the file in vps, there is less of limitations so we can found more IP addresses for a website
